Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise Frontend Challenge
I hosted the project on firebase to check out my work please use this link [https://fetchrewardsfse.firebaseapp.com/]

I choose to use DataGrid by material-ui as it provides an easy to use table while providing additional filter and sorting without having to write a bunch of extra code for it.
[https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/style/]

I kept the styling to a min.

To run the project in Visual Studio Code,

### Download the code from [http://github.com/NCRadtke00/FRFSE]

### Wherever the code was downloaded to, open that folder in your terminal of choice and type in code . to open in visual studio.
