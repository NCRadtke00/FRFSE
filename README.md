Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise Frontend Challenge
I hosted the project on firebase to check out my work please use this link  [https://fetchrewardsfse.firebaseapp.com/]

I choose to use DataGrid by material-ui as it provides awesome additional filter and sorting functions without having to write a bunch of extra code for it
[https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/style/]

To run the project in Visual Studio Code,
### Download the code from (http://github.com/NCRadtke00/FRFSE)
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
